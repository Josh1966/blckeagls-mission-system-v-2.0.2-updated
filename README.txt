Included is an updated version of blckeagls mission system. It is based on version 2.0.2 as updated by Narines. 
This is not my work, except to update the existing mission framework.

	Matt11 (Wicked AI)Updates include the following:

* Bug Fixes:
	Errors generated by loading loot into crates were fixed.
	All missions now correctly send messages to players.

*Changes
	SystemChat is used to broadcast messages to clients rather than titleText. 
	The white marker was changed to orange
	Markers were enlarged.

* Additions
	Crates are loaded with random loot selected from tables specific to each mission.
	AI move more within a certain radius of the mission center.
	Stray AI are cleaned up once the mission is over.
	AI learn where their killer was after each AI death. This information makes them more aggressive toward players.
	AI skills are configurable for each mission type.
	A greater diversity of loot has been included in the loot tables.
	A "killed" event handler was added.
	AI at each Mission are divided into several independent groups 
	AI move around
	A setting was added which when true prevents missions spawning withinin 1000 m of player spawn points.
	A setting was added with which a blacklist of mission spawn points can be defined.
	A function to detect the map and define map center and dimensions was added.

* Optimizations
	AI and loot are not spawned until a player is within 1000 meters of the mission center to reduce server load.
	Most code is loaded into memory and precompiled with the hope this will reduce server load.
	Some code was moved into functions.
	The loop for running and rerunning missions was moved into a separate file. 

* Known Issues
	AI sometimes shoot through walls
	AI sometimes wander quite far from the mission center. This can be addressed by changing "RED" to "YELLOW" on line 30 in spawnai.sqf. However this change makes AI less prone to engage players shooting from a distance.
	Players die alot - You can reduce the number of AI and their skills (see below).
	Vehicles are spawned as permenant additions to the database which may cause issues down the road. Vehicles can not be sold at traders using the default Epoch code.  I have not tested vehicles with the current AI patrol setup.
