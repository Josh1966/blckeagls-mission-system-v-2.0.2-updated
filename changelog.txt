blck Mission system by Ghostrider-DBD-
Loosely based on the AI mission system by blckeagls ver 2.0.2
Contributions by Narines: bug fixes, testing, 'fired' event handler
Ideas or code from that by it07, Vampire and KiloSwiss have been used for certain functions.

9-19-16 Ver 5.1.2/11/16
Minor bug fixes to support Exile.
-Corrected errors with scout and hunter missions trying to spawn using Epoch headgear.
-Corrected error wherein AI were spawned as Epoch soldiers
-Inactivated a call to an exile function that had no value 

9-15-16 vER 6.1.1
1) Reverted to the old spawnUnits routine because the new one was not spawning AI at Hunters correctly.

9-13-16 Ver 6.10
1) Added waypoints for spawned AI Vehicles.
2) Reworked the logic for generating the positions of these waypoints
3) Added loiter waypoints in addition to move wayponts.
4) Reworked the param/params for spawnUnits
5) several other minor optimizations.

9-3-16 Ver 6.0
1) Re-did the custom_server folder so the mod automatically starts. Blck_client.sqf no longer calls the mod from the server.
2) Added a variable blck_modType which presently can be either "Epoch" or "Exile" with the aim of having a single mission system for both mods.
3) Added a more intelligent method for loading key components (variables, functions, and map-specific parameters).
4) Re-did all code to automatically select correct parameters to run correctly on either exile or epoch servers.
5) Added the Exile Static Loot Crate Spawner; Re-did this to load either an exile or epoch version as needed since a lot of the variables and also the locations tables are unique.
6) FEATURE DISABLED
7) Pulled the map addons function from the Exile build and added a functionality to spawn addons appropriately for map and mod type.
8) FEATURE DISABLED
9) FEATURE DISABLED
10) Added settings to enable / disable specific mission classes, e.g., blck_enableOrangeMissions. Set to 1 to enable, -1 to disable.

8-14-16
Added mission timout feature, set blck_missionTimout = -1 to disble;
Changed to use of params for all .sqf which also eliminated calls to BIS_fnc_params
changed to selectRandom for all .sqf

Added the armed powerler to the list of default mission vehicles.

2/28/16
1) Bug fixes completed. Cleanup of bodies is now properly separated from cleanup of live AI. Cleanup of vehicles with live AI is now working correctly.
3) Next step will be to add in the heli reinforcements for ver 5.2 (still in the works).

2/20/16
Bugfixes and enhancements.
1) added checks for nearby bases or nearby players when spawning missions.
2) Fixed typos in Medical Camp missions.
3) Added two new modes for completing mission: 1) mission is complete when all AI are killed; 2) mission is complete when player reaches the crate OR when all AI are killed.

In Progress
1) Mission timouts
2) Added optional reinforcments via helicopters which can then patrol the mission area.

2/11/16
Major Update to Build 5.0

2) The mission timer now calles a file containing the mission parameters. The mission spawner is included and run from that file.
3) A kill feed was added reporting each AI kill.
4) AI kills are now handled via an event handler run on the server for forward compatability with headless clients.
5) Multiple minor errors and bug fixes related to mission difficulty, AI loadouts, loot and other parameters were included. 
6) The first phase of restructuring of the file structure has been completed. Most code for functions and units has been moved to a compiles directory in Compiles\Units and Compiles\Functions.
7) Some directionality and randomness was added where mission objects are spawned at random locations from an array of objects to give the missions more of a feeling of a perimeter defense where H-barrier and other objects were added.
8) As part of the restructuing, variables were moved from AIFunctions to a separate file.
9) Bugs in routines for cleanup of dead and live AI were fixed. A much simpler system for tracking live AI, dead AI, locations of active and recent missions, was implemented because of the centralization of the mission spawning to a single script

	Build 3.56
	Added: headgear and goggles are now added to AI.
	Fixed: incorrect number of AI spawned at missions.
	
Current Build
	Build 3.5
	startBlack.sqf was replaced with blckClient.sqf to avoid problems due to the many changes in the client file.
	Added: blck_useSignalEnd which, when true, causes a smoke grenade to be depolyed at the loot crate and to persist for several min (still a work in progress but seems to be fine on our servers).
	Added: blck_labelMapMarkers in AIConfig.sqf which is a configuration option to add text label to map markers and configure how that text is shown (by an arrow or dot). 
	Added: blck_preciseMapMarkersin AIConfig which is a configuration option that when false causes the marker to be randomly placed  somewhere around the mission area.
	Added: blck_useSignalEnd determines whether a smoke grenade is deployed at the crate upon mission completion.
	Added: a new type of mission marker showing the location of completed missions. This marker despawns after a time set by blck_MarkerPeristTime in the blckClient.sqf file in the mission.pbo
	Added: The misson system now supports multiple loot chests that can be spawned in at any offset and elevation relative to the mission center so that mission designers can place them inside buildings or in other locations off the ground.  
		Each loot chest can be loaded with a number of weapons, magazines, optics, etc defined in its configuration. The default loot configuration is that in AIConfigs.sqf but you have an option of defining other loot arrays locally for that mission.
		The type, offset and loot table for each crate is defined in the \Compositions\Compositions.sqf file for that mission class.
	Added: You can now spawn vehicles at mission and, if you like, add loot to them. The type of vehicle and its loot are define in \Compositions\Commpositions.sqf for that mission class.
	Added: Compositions are now much more flexible. See configuration _default2 in \Major\Compositions for some examples. You may:
			1) any number of spawn loot chests in any location;
			2) load loot chests with the default gear arrays or define additional arrays specific to the mission. 
			3) spawn vehicles and load them with loot as above.
			4) Spawn landscapes output by objectgrabber or in the format used by this script.
			5) Define custom static weapons to be spawned at that mission. These will be manned by 1 AI.
			6) Define custom Vehicles to be used by AI Vehicles at each mission. These will be manned by 3 AI.
	Added: The location of recently completed missions is shown with a black square marker.
	Added: the types of notifications of mission events are configurable in blckClient. You may show one or more of the following types of allerts:
			Hint, systemChat, titleText.
	Changed: blck_SmokeAtMissions sets whether a smoking wreck is spawned near the mission. Added a variable to determine whether the wreck is next to the mission center and default crate location or random.
	Changed: added brief delays after each object or AI is spawned. Not sure if this will help with reducing lag/network traffic spikes when a mission spawns but that was my hope.
	Fixed: AI should now use launchers properly.
	Fixed: blck_AIPatrolVehicles now correctly determines the default vehicles used in AI patrols at missions.
	
	Known issues:
		Due to collisions objects do not always spawn. I have seen this with smoking wrecks.
		In rare instances, loot chests seem to spawn undergound. 
		
	Build 3.42b
		Added: Map dimensions for Esseker and Australia
		Added: Spawns are included in the blacklisted locations for Australia, Esseker, and Takistan
		
	Build 3.42
	Fixed: Players were not penalized for killing AI using weapons on vehicles in the forbiden list.
		When blck_VG_Gear is true, two lists are checked when an AI is killed by a player in a vehicle:
			blck_forbidenVehicles - a list of vehicles for which a penalty should be applied
			blck_forbidenVehicleGuns - a list of vehicle-mounted guns for which a penalty should be applied after an AI is killed by a player using that gun.
		If either the vehicle or gun is present in these lists then blck_RunGearDamage is applied to the player's vehicle.
	Added: Map center and range added for Australia - needs verification.

	Build 3.4
	Added Configuration information for Esseker
	Added an option to spawn AI vehicles around the mission. By default these are armed pickups but other vehicles can be used by changing the vehicle types in blck_AI_Vehicles on line 38 of AIConfigs.sqf.
	Changed: A complete re-working of the code for spawning AI and static weapons to eliminate redundancy and hopefully improve performance.
	Changed: Location of the smoking wreck was move outside the perimeter of the mission to reduce collisions with mission base objects.
	Changed: location of static weapons was moved out to make them more effective.

	Build 3.31 7-4-15
	Added Configuration information for Esseker

	Build 3.3 6-10-15
	Added: spawn mines in the vicinity of missions (blck_useMines = true; line 24, AIConfigs.sqf)
	Added: Checks to prevent missions from spawning at water's edge or with 1000 meter of a town.
	Added:  when blck_RunGear = true, AI are stripped of gear when run over or killed by a vehicle's gun, and damage is applied to the vehicle, to make up for the fact that AI can not be forced to shoot vehicles at present (line 23 of AIConfig.sqf)
	Added: several optional disincentives to running over or gunning down AI from vehicles
		blck_VG_Gear = true; // When set to true, AI that have been killed by a gun on  a vehicle will be stripped of gear and the vehicle will be given blck_RunGearDamage of damage
		blck_VK_GunnerDamage = true;  // When true vehicles are damaged if they are in blck_forbidenVehicles. 

	Turrets on static weapons are locked now which prevents players from disassembling them.	
	Changed: unused code removed
	Changed: variable that sets the time delay to cleanup of ai corpses to blck_bodyCleanUpTimer (line 46 of AIConfigs.sqf)
	Change: rather than spawing a cleanup routine to delete AI bodies, they are marked for cleanup by the default Epoch cleanup engine.
	Changed: variables in AIConfig.sqf are grouped by function and more documentation was added.
	Changes: other code updates and optimizations.
	Fixed: Bodies of dead AI were sometimes being deleted too early.
	
	Build 3.2 5-21-15
	- Bug fix for static weapons.

	Build 3.1 5-11-15
	Changed: method for spawning crates to try to prevent crates from being spawned underground.
	Other Changes:
	- code for spawning crates was moved to a function (spawnCrate.sqf)
	- code to prevent cleanup of crates was simplified
	- Files modified: AIFunctions.sqf, SM1.sqf in each of the mission folders.

	Build 3.0 4-25-15 - substantial redesign of some parts of the code
	Thank you cyncrwler for help with many issues including testing and troubleshooting

	- added: Marksman DLC weapons and ammo added to crates and AI Weapons.
	- added blck_Initialized variable which can be used to check if the mission system is fully loaded.
	- added: blck_useNVG option which when true will cause AI to spawn with NVG when it is dark. NVG will be removed from AI bodies when they are killed (the deletion of NVG from AI is not yet working).
	- added: blck_useSmokeAtCrates option when when true will spawn a smoking object near the crate.

	- changed: a new start_blck.sqf which must be used to replace the existing start_blck.sqf in yoru mission.pbo. 
    	- Changed: reduced the number of times AI will try to man static weapons to 1.

	- Changed: complete re-working of the system for selecting and adding weapons and ammo to AI which includes adding HE grenade rounds if the AI spawn with an M203 equiped weapon
	- Changed: Complete re-working of the code for adding items to AI which includes adding food and drink;  
		
	- fixed: added a getOut event handler to static weapons which should prevent players from accessing them. vehicleMonitor is not presently used.
	- fixed: FAK or grenade are now added based on chance, and the situation whereby AI would be loaded with many grenades has been fixed.

	- Known Issues: 
		missions and helicrashes sometimes spawn together. When they do, the mission loot and AI will not spawn. Only a server restart will correct this.
		AI do not use their launchers.

	- To Do: Enable a penalty for running over AI. Complete projects for adding compositions at missions. 

	Build 2.23 4-21-15
	- corrected a minor error that delayed messages announcing that missions were over and also the timely spawning of the next mission of that type (Blue, Red, Green etc).

	Build 2.22 4-19-15
	- vehicleMonitor.sqf reverted to older bug-free version for now.
	- Addressed undefined variable errors in addons\addmarker.sqf and other addmarker scripts in the client's addons folder.
			
	Build 2.21 4-18-15

	- Replaced armed pickups with static MG or Grenade launcher
	- Added script that forces the nearest AI to man static gun if the gunner is killed
	- Added a routine to cleanup spawned objects such as machine guns or base objects
	- Removed weapons fitted with sights from AI and crates as these were causing BE addweaponcargo issues. One can now run the default BE filter for addweaponcargo.txt
	- Added new a category of items for the crates: optics which is configurable
	- Added code which permits one to add customize mission with respect to the mission messages and items that spawn. This involved adding 'compositions' defined in arrays. See the examples in the composition folder for each mission class for examples.
	- Unused code removed

	build 1.2 2-10-2015
	- calls to spawn vehicles and load AI into them removed from spawnai.sqf
	- calls to spawn vehicles loaded with AI added to each of the mission files
	- spawnVehicle.sqf redone to add a for loop that spawns _noVeh vehicles loaded with AI.
	- The number of vehicles to be spawned is set in AIconfigs.sqf on lines 64 - 67.

	- added beverage and food list to items to be added to crates in AIConfig.
	- added the function for alerting AI to killer location to AIKilled
	- AIKilled added to precompiled scripts for performance enhancement
		
	build alpha
	- added AIFunctions.sqf in which functions are defined and frequently used .sqf are precompiled
	- code revised to call precompiled functions where possible
