Installation:

1) Unpack the Zip file to a folder in a convenient location.
2) Copy custom_server.pbo from the bin\@epochhive\addons folder to the @epochhive\addons folder in your server directory.
3) Copy the epoch.Altis, epoch.Stratis and epoch.Chernarus from bin\MPMissions to MPMissions in your server directory.
4) copy scripts.txt from \Battleye to the Battleye directory in your server directory.

Customized installs:

I assume that you already have created an init.sqf, or used one provided with another mod, and that it is already included it in your mission file (e.g., epoch.Altis.pbo)

Unpack your mission pbo. Open the folder you just created.
Open this directory and copy the debug folder and file called start_black.sqf from MPMissions into the folder you just created by unpacking your mission pbo.
Add the following at the top of your init.sqf:

	[] execVM "start_blck.sqf"
Repack your mission pbo and you should be good to go.

If you have already modified your scripts.txt to accomodate other addons, you will need to add this on line 22, which begins 7 exec:

	!="execVM "\q\addons\custom_server\init.sqf";" !="execVM "start_blck.sqf";" !="	[] execVM "debug\addmarkers.sqf"; !="execVM "debug\addmarkers2.sqf";" !="execVM "debug\addmarkers75.sqf";" !="execVM "debug\addmarkers752.sqf";
